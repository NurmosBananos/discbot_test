# DiscBot
Discord bot for fetching information about disc golf discs

##Summary
DiscBot is an open source Discord bot created by Aaron Baxter under the GNU General Public License v3.0

Users can interact with DiscBot (using [commands](https://app.pixel5.us/discbot/commands)) to quickly find information about discs, plastics, PDGA statistics, and more. Users may also create their own virtual 'bag' to show others which discs they are carrying and find out what others are using as well.

DiscBot utilizes [Discord.io](https://github.com/izy521/discord.io), a Node.js library for interfacing with the [Discord API](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/intro) (Gateway 6). External data is retrieved and stored using the private pixel5.us API (RESTful/Slim API Framework v3), PDGA information is publicly available on [PDGA.com](http://pdga.com/).
